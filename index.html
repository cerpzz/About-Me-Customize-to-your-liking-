        I've coded some projects until now, but they were mostly AI-based. I'm
        making this website mostly without AI. I have used AI for some help,
        such as the sidebar. Speaking of the sidebar, you can view my other
        sites by clicking the 'My Other Sites' button! Thank you!!
